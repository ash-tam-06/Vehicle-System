This is a simple vehicle renting system. It allows users to choose between multiple options, like adding a vehicle to the system, renting a vehicle, or returning a vehicle.
After user inputs an option, they are asked questions to complete the task. Once the task is complete, users are able to choose if they would like to do something else or exit the system.
